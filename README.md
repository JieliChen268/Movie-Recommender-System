# Movie-Recommender-System
- Used Netflix data as input to recommend movies according to the movies that users watched and rated.
- Used Collaborative Filtering algorithm for this recommender system because the number of users weighs more than number of products
- Built a user rating matrix to represent which movies were related
- Created a co-occurrence matrix to represent the relationship between different movies
- Multiplied user rating matrix and co-occurrence matrix to get a merged recommender list for users.
- Implemented 4 MapReduce jobs in Intellij IDEA to do matrix multiplication
